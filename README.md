# Chandra Station

Built with three.js Chandra Stations new website will be a unique experience with useability in mind. After two years of "making it work" our current site is cluttered and has the usual "Cosmos validator" experience.


### Ideas

Lines in the shape of the craters floating directly above the moon that rise and get brighter on hover then provide a tag with a name/label and are clickable 

### Problems

* menu close 
* Chandra text curve
* aliasing
* performance
